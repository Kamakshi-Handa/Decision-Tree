# Decision-Tree
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences, visually represented as a tree structure. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, while the leaf nodes represent the predicted outcome or label.
